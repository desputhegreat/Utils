# Python Utilities

A collection of practical Python scripts developed as I learn the language. These projects focus on automation, system maintenance, and networking.

## Projects Included

### 1. Multi-threaded Port Scanner
A high-performance network tool that checks for open ports on a given IP. 
* **Key Feature:** Uses `threading` and `queue` for speed.
* **Logic:** Implements a custom result-collection list to avoid console output overlapping from multiple threads.

### 2. File Integrity Hasher
A security utility to generate and verify file hashes using SHA256.
* **Key Feature:** Chunk-based reading to handle large files without memory crashes.
* **Mode:** Supports both 'create' (baseline) and 'verify' modes.

### 3. System Cleaner
An automation script to clear temporary Windows directories and the Recycle Bin.
* **Note:** Requires Administrator privileges for full system access.
* **Safety:** Includes a confirmation prompt before deletion.

### 4. Smart File Sorter
Organizes messy folders by moving files into categorized subfolders based on extensions.
* **Logic:** Custom extension-parsing that handles complex filenames.
